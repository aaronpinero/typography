# Tyfy
A personal framework for typographic styles on the web based on ideas from https://archetypeapp.com.

## There are a lot of frameworks. Why are you doing this?

There are two primary reasons:

* To collect all of my best design and pattern work into one system.
* To create a system of styles that I can employ in future projects.

A framework is an expression of the values, preferences, priorities, and experience of the person or persons creating it. While I like some existing frameworks (Bootstrap 4, PureCSS), I want something that reflects my values and the work that I do.

I realize that without the benefit of work previously done by others, this project would not happen. Since those frameworks are part of my experience, my work reflects theirs as well.

## Dependencies
FontAwesome 5 is required for some elements. It should be installed separately in the project root as a directory named "fontawesome".
