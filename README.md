# Tyfy

My framework for applying elements of typographic style to web projects. See the [online docs and demos](http://aaronpinero.net/tyfy/docs/index.html) and [the Medium article](https://medium.com/@aaronpinero/why-tyfy-1665e36b4f94.)

## Version 2

Version 2 of Tyfy is not backwards compatible with the current release (1.4.5). There are numerous improvements.
