# Tyfy
My personal framework for applying typographic styles and options on the web.

## Why build *another* framework?

There are two reasons:

* To collect all of my best design and pattern work into one system.
* To create a system that I can employ in future projects.

A framework is an expression of the values, preferences, priorities, and experience of the person or persons creating it. While I like some existing frameworks (Bootstrap 4, PureCSS), I want  something that reflects my values and the work that I do.

## Dependencies

Two additional repos are necessary for this project:

* [FontAwesome Pro](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro) - clone to `resources/fontawesome`
* [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) - clone to `resources/normalize`

## Additional thanks

I realize that without the benefit of work previously done by others, this project would not happen. Since those frameworks are part of my experience, my work reflects theirs as well. Tyfy is a combination of something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue from some of the following works:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com)
* [Archetype](https://archetypeapp.com)
* The [Columbia College](https://www.college.columbia.edu) Style Guide
* [PureCSS](https://purecss.io)
* [Better Web Type](https://betterwebtype.com)
