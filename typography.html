		<h1>Typography</h1>
		<p>A personal framework for applying typographic styles and options on the web.</p>
		<ul class="list-icons list-icons-angle">
			<li><a href="paragraphs.html">Paragraphs</a></li>
			<li><a href="links.html">Links</a></li>
			<li><a href="lists.html">Lists</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>There are a lot of frameworks. Why are you doing this?</h2>
		<p>There are two primary reasons:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To collect all of my best design and pattern work into one system.</li>
			<li>To create a system of styles that I can employ in future projects.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>A framework is an expression of the values, preferences, priorities, and experience of the person or persons creating it. While I like some existing frameworks (Bootstrap 4, PureCSS), I want  something that reflects my values and the work that I do.</p>
		<p>I realize that without the benefit of work previously done by others, this project would not happen. Since those frameworks are part of my experience, my work reflects theirs as well.</p>
