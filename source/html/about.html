      <h1>About Tyfy</h1>
      <p class="lede"><strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> is a framework for applying elements of typographic style to your front-end development.</p>
      <p>I first named this project “typography” for my effort to encode typographic rules and patterns. The name later changed to a short form of the portmanteau “typogrify”. So “<strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong>” rhymes with “WiFi” or “Sci-Fi”.</p>
      <p>For more information about how <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> came to be, you can read <a href="https://medium.com/@aaronpinero/why-tyfy-1665e36b4f94">the Medium article</a>.</p>
      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <p>There are three reasons why <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> was created:</p>
      <ul class="sibling-margins-off">
        <li>To collect all of my best design and pattern work into one system.</li>
        <li>To create tolls that enhance my front-end development workflow.</li>
        <li>To learn something along the way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A framework is an expression of the values, preferences, priorities, and experience of the person or persons creating it. While I embrace some existing frameworks (Bootstrap 4, PureCSS), I wanted to create something that reflects my values and the work that I do.</p>
      <h2>Thanks</h2>
      <p>This project would not have happened without the benefit of work done by others. Their contributions to front-end development are part of my experience, and so my work reflects theirs. <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> has something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue from the following sources:</p>
