        <h2>v2.0.0 - 2019-09-28</h2>
        <p>This list of changes is just the highlights. There isn't a <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> module that hasn't been significantly updated. As a result, this version of the framework is not compatable with the previous version. You cannot replace v1.4.5 with v2.0.0 and expect it to work.</p>
        <h3>Major changes from v1.4.5:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>jQuery dependency has been removed.</li>
          <li>All variable names have been changed. Most have been shortened to use <code>$ty</code> as a prefix instead of <code>$tyfy</code>.</li>
          <li>Variables have been reorganized; there are only three variables defined in the <code>_core.scss</code> module. Most remaining variables have been moved to the <code>_settings.scss</code> module.</li>
          <li>Indent variables have been removed, replaced with spacing variables.</li>
          <li><span class="smallcaps">SASS</span> maps are now used for spacing, font size, and time duration variables. New functions have been added to facilitate use of values in <span class="smallcaps">SASS</span> maps.</li>
          <li>Adjustment variables for the <i>tylead</i> function have been moved to the <code>_functions.scss</code> module.</li>
          <li>Color variables have been simplified; reverse color variables have been moved to the <code>_reverse.scss</code> module.</li>
          <li>Color manipulation functions have been removed.</li>
          <li>Mixins have been renamed for consistency.</li>
          <li>Numerous class names have been changed to use <code>ty</code> as a name prefix.</li>
          <li>The <code>_reverse.scss</code> and <code>_effects.scss</code> modules have been recategorized as extras.</li>
          <li>The <code>_drupal.scss</code> module has been removed.</li>
          <li>The <code>_responsive_text.scss</code> extras module has been rewritten.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Major additions from v1.4.5:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Colors are assigned to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> using <span class="smallcaps">CSS</span> custom properties. This makes it easier to manipulate color values. It also allowed a complete rewrite and simplification of the <code>_reverse.scss</code> module.</li>
          <li>New functions have been added to facilitate use of values in <span class="smallcaps">SASS</span> maps.</li>
          <li>Additional icon options have been added for bulleted lists with custom icons for bullets.</li>
          <li>For forms, the <code>tyselect</code> class for custom <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements can be applied either directly to the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element or to a containing element.</li>
          <li>Javascript files have been minified; unminified javascript, with full comments, are available in the source directory.</li>
          <li>The documentation has been completely redesigned and rewritten.</li>
          <li>Test files have been developed to verify modules function.</li>
        </ul>
