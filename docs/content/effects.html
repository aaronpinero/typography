        <p>I added this module because it was an opportunity to experiment with <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-sass-maps-usage-and-examples--cms-22184"><span class="smallcaps">SASS</span> maps</a>. In this case, I have used a sass map to generate a number of classes that, when applied to an element, cause that element to fade in when the page is loaded. The duration of the fade animation depends on the class used.</p>
        <p>To apply a fade in animation of arbitrary duration, there is a mixin that accepts duration as a variable.</p>
        <p>For now, this is the only effect available. I may add more effects at a later time. I welcome <a href="https://github.com/aaronpinero/typography/issues">suggestions</a> for particular effects.</p>
