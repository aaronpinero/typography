        <p class="lede"><strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> is a framework for incorporating elements of typographic style into front-end development.</p>
        <p>At first, I named this project “typography”. This accurately described my goal of encoding typographic rules and patterns. The name later changed to a short form of the portmanteau “typogrify”. So <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> rhymes with “WiFi” or “Sci-Fi”.</p>
        <p>For more information about how <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> came to be, you can read <a href="https://medium.com/@aaronpinero/why-tyfy-1665e36b4f94">the Medium article</a>.</p>
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>There are three reasons why I started <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong>:</p>
        <ul class="tymargins-off">
          <li>To collect all of my best practices into one system.</li>
          <li>To improve my development workflow.</li>
          <li>To learn something along the way.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A framework is an expression of the values, preferences, priorities, and experience of its creators. While I embrace some existing frameworks (Bootstrap, PureCSS), I want to create something that reflects my values and the work that I do.</p>
        <h2>Thanks</h2>
        <p>This project would not have happened without the benefit of work done by others. Their contributions to front-end development are part of my experience, and so my work reflects theirs. <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> has something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue from the following sources:</p>
