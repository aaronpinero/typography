        <h3>Justified</h3>
        <pre class="codebox" data-lang="HTML"><code class="code-nobg language-html">&lt;p class="justified"&gt;I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don’t worry. I’ll leave. First I’m going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It’s our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on… that’s it. Give the evacuation code signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="justified"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don’t believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I’ve never seen anything to make me believe there’s one all-powerful force controlling everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can’t even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I want to come with you to Alderaan. There’s nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They’re for sale if you want them.&lt;/p&gt;
