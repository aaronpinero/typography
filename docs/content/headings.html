        <p>Font sizes for heading levels 1 through 6 are based on the <a href="scale.html">modular scale</a>. Heading font sizes are also available as <span class="smallcaps">SASS</span> variables and <span class="smallcaps">CSS</span> classes.</p>
        <h2 id="spacing">Spacing</h2>
        <p><strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> headings are positioned closer to the text following the heading than the text preceding. <a href="margins.html">Adjacent sibling selectors</a> are used to define the margins for headings in context of other elements. If the element preceding a heading is not also a heading, the top margin for the heading will be larger than the standard margin. In <span class="smallcaps">CSS</span>, this is accomplished as follows:</p>
        <pre class="codebox" data-lang="SCSS"><code class="code-nobg language-scss">* + * {
  margin-top: $tyspacing-md;
}
:not(h1) + h2 {
  margin-top: $tyspacing-lg;
}</code></pre>
        <h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>.tyfont-size-h[x]</dt>
          <dd>Display an element using the font size and line height of heading level x.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2 id="sizes">Size Variables</h2>
        <p>A <span class="smallcaps">SASS</span> map is used to set heading font sizes based on the modular scale. Map values are integers indicating a number of steps up or down the scale from the base font size. The default map values (which include sizes for headings and other elements) are shown below.</p>
        <pre class="codebox" data-lang="SCSS"><code class="code-nobg language-scss">$tyfont-size: (
"sm":         -1,
"h6":         0,
"h5":         1,
"h4":         2,
"h3":         3,
"h2":         4,
"h1":         6,
"quote":      2,
"lede":       2
) !default;</code></pre>
        <p>Font size variables for headings are calculated using the values in the <span class="smallcaps">SASS</span> map and the <a href="scale.html"><em>tyscale</em></a> function.</p>
        <pre class="codebox" data-lang="SCSS"><code class="code-nobg language-scss">$tyfont-size-h6: tyscale(map-get($tyfont-size,"h6")) !default;

$tyfont-size-h4: tyscale(map-get($tyfont-size,"h4")) !default;
$tyfont-size-h3: tyscale(map-get($tyfont-size,"h3")) !default;

&lt;p&gt;Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
