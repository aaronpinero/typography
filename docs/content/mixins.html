			<h1>Mixins</h1>
			<p><strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> includes several <span class="smallcaps">SASS</span> mixins. Some mixins were copied or borrowed from <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and are generally useful for any project. The remaining mixins facilitate the application of the 'smart' vertical margins between adjacent siblings.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>@mixin clearfix</dt>
				<dd>Copied directly from HTML5 Boilerplate for dealing with floats.</dd>
				<dt>@mixin visuallyhidden ($type:true)</dt>
				<dd>A customization of a similar mixin from HTML5 Boilerplate for obscuring elements without using the more disruptive <code>display:none</code></dd>
				<dt>@mixin set-sibling-margins ($context:all, $measure:$tyfy-spacing-standard)</dt>
				<dd>A mixin for setting the value of the vertical margin between adjacent siblings. The <code>all</code> context employs the lobotomized owl selector for margins between all elements. The <code>headings</code> context applies margin between a heading and a preceding non-heading element. The <code>lists</code> context applies margin between child element of definition, ordered, and unordered lists.</dd>
				<dt>@mixin sibling-margins ($state:on)</dt>
				<dd>A mixin for turning the vertical margin between adjacent siblings on an off. It depends on the <code>set-sibling-margins</code> mixin.</dd>
				<dt>@mixin fade-in($duration:1000ms)</dt>
				<dd>An effect that fades in the element to which the mixin is applied. The mixin accepts a duration as an argument; the default is <code>1000ms</code>.</dd>
				<dt>@mixin button($color_default:$tyfy-color-link-default,$color_active:$tyfy-color-link-active,$border_radius:tygrid(0.25))</dt>
				<dd>A mixin for displaying a link or other tag as a button.</dd>
				<dt>@mixin button-outline($color_default:$tyfy-color-link-default,$color_active:$tyfy-color-link-active,$border_radius:tygrid(0.25))</dt>
				<dd>A mixin for displaying a link or other tag as an outlined button.</dd>
