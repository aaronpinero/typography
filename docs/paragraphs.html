      <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
			<p>Paragraphs inherit font size and line height from the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. <strong class="tyfy">Tyfy</strong> provides <span class="smallcaps">CSS</span> classes for common style variations.</p>
			<h2>Classes</h2>
			<dl>
  			<dt><code>&lt;p class="<em class="class">lede</em>"&gt;</code></dt>
  			<dd>Display a paragraph as a lede. Font size of a lede is equal to <code>$tyfy-font-size-lede</code>.</dd>
  			<dt><code>&lt;p class="<em class="class">justified</em>"&gt;</code></dt>
  			<dd>Display a paragraph with justified text.</dd>
  			<dt><code>&lt;tag class="<em class="class">paragraphs-justified</em>"&gt;</code></dt>
    		<dd>Display all child paragraphs with justified text.</dd>
  			<dt><code>&lt;tag class="<em class="class">cols-2</em>"&gt;</code></dt>
    		<dd>Display content in two columns. The style is responsive and degrades to a single column when the screen width is less than the value of <code>$tyfy-break-cols-2</code>.</dd>
			</dl>
			<h2>Variables</h2>
			<dl>
  			<dt><code><em class="var">$tyfy-break-cols-2</em>: 50em !default;</code></dt>
  			<dd>Breakpoint above which text inside an element with the <code>cols-2</code> class is displayed in two columns.</dd>
  			<dt><code><em class="var">$tyfy-font-size-lede</em>: tyscale(map-get($tyfy-font-sizes,"lede")) !default;</code>
  			<dd>Font size applied to a paragraph with the <code>lede</code> class.</dd>
			</dl>
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<h3>Lede</h3>
			<pre class="codebox"><code>&lt;p class="lede"&gt;Luke, we’re ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we’ll contact you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we’ll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I’ll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

			<h3>Justified</h3>
			<pre class="codebox"><code>&lt;p class="justified"&gt;I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don’t worry. I’ll leave. First I’m going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It’s our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on… that’s it. Give the evacuation code signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraphs-justified"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don’t believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I’ve never seen anything to make me believe there’s one all-powerful force controlling everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can’t even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

			<h3>Two Columns</h3>
			<pre class="codebox"><code>&lt;div class="cols-2"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to come with you to Alderaan. There’s nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They’re for sale if you want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
